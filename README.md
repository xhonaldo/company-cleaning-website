Cleaning Company Website with AI Chat Assistant
I developed a modern cleaning company website using Next.js for fast, SEO-friendly performance and a clean user experience. The platform integrates an AI-powered chat assistant built with Google Gemini, enabling customers to ask questions, get instant service recommendations, and receive booking guidance in real time. The solution highlights services, pricing, and contact options, while providing a professional digital presence tailored to the companyâ€™s brand.
